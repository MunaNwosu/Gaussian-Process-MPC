## General info
This research project explores a method to improve the future performance of a dynamic system using past system data. 
Navigating from one point to another while avoiding obstacles and changes in its environment and payload can be challenging, as these changes can lead to poor tracking performance and instability. This project simulates a quadrotor utilizing GPMPC in a 2d space.

## Technologies
This project was created with:
* Ubuntu 20.04
* python 3.8
* gpytorch
* casadi
* sklearn

## Setup
To run this project install the neccesery dependencies and run quad_2d_trajectory.py
